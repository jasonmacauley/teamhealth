# Team Health Manager

###A few installation notes
* To establish the route organization use the rails console to create and 
org with type "root" and organization_id "0".
You'll need to use `.save(validate: FALSE)` to save it.
* To build all of the targets use the rails console to run `BaseTarget.new`
